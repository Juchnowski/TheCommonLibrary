        This is a help file to explain how the procedure works. Make this however you wish.
    </p>

    <p>
        A good idea is to explain:
        <ol>
            <li>The core functionality of the program and what problem it is designed to solve</li>
            <li>The settings and what they are, along with the requirements (such as "name must start with a letter")</li>
            <li>The list of procedures, their requirements, and a description of what they do.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        If you make the html file in your project (such as this example) remember to go into the properties
        for the html and set the copy action to "copy always" or "copy if newer" to that the file will be created in the output directory
    </p>
